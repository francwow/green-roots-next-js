// Atomic Design - Brad Frost

Nowadays websites are being developed from the ground up,
meaning we first think about the individual pieces that make up the whole system.

Atomic Deisgn proposes that we create digital products similiar to how things 
in the material world are made:

  ->Atoms ->Molecules ->Organisms ->Templates ->Pages

  -This approach lets us focus on the main structure of the website first and
  add styles, typography, color, etc, at the end of the process where its easier 
  to make changes based on the client's feedback.

Benefits of stablishing a pattern library under this Design filosophy:

  1. Easier to test.
  2. Better workflow.
  3. Shared vocabulary.
  4. Useful reference.
